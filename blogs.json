        "question" : "What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
        "answer": "An access token is like a permission slip that allows a user to access certain things for a limited time. It's a short-lived pass. A refresh token is a special pass that can be used to get a new access token when the old one expires. Refresh tokens are important and should be stored in a safe place, like a locked box, to prevent unauthorized access.",
